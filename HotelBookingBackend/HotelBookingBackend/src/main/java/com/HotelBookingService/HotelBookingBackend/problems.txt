1. bookings in the user are going in the infinite loop!

A. [Solved] with adding @JsonIgnore to all of my relationships


2. how to get rooms between startDate and endDate of filter.
    -> the booking_id which is in the rooms table should be the nextBooking, which is not a forever thing!
    -> Should it be like a corn job, that goes through the database
    -> [Possible Solution] --> go through bookings, get roomIds that are in between StartDate and EndDate, then
        get all rooms that are not in that list!
    -> [Solved] Simple Join query done the job for now, Also learnt that in Spring JPARepositories and ENTITIES,
    while using named queries, you can directly use other entities as if tables are served to you, spring does a
    lot in the background!

3. Design Mistake in Database Relationships!
    -> I made it as room -> booking is oneToMany thinking at any time, only room is linked to one booking!
    -> That's true, but for business use case, the bookings will have previous as well as upcoming also,
    -> We need to model it as ManyToMany.
    -> Then there will junction table containing b_id, r_id.
    -> [Solved/Refactored] -> It's very easy in the spring data jpa to change it!
